# 1. Project Overview

Virtual Machines and Containers are two widely used approaches for deploying applications and workloads.

A Virtual Machine provides an isolated operating-system environment through a hypervisor, while a container provides process-level isolation while sharing the host operating-system kernel.

This project experimentally compares the performance of these two environments under identical workloads.

The study evaluates:

* CPU performance
* Memory performance
* Disk I/O performance
* Network performance
* Application performance
* Startup time
* Resource utilization
* Scalability under increasing workloads

The experiments use repeated measurements, raw benchmark outputs, processed CSV data, statistical analysis, and graphical visualization.

The objective is to understand the measured performance characteristics of each environment rather than assuming beforehand that one environment will always perform better.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Virtual Machines and Containers provide isolated environments for running applications, but they differ in their virtualization and resource-management approaches.

Virtual Machines generally include a complete guest operating system, while containers share the host operating-system kernel.

These architectural differences can affect:

* CPU execution
* Memory operations
* Storage I/O
* Network throughput
* Application response time
* Startup time
* Resource utilization
* Scalability

Therefore, there is a need for a controlled experimental study that executes the same workloads in both environments and compares their measured performance.

### Problem Statement

> To experimentally evaluate and compare the performance, resource utilization, application behavior, startup time, and scalability of Virtual Machines and Docker Containers under identical workloads and controlled resource configurations.

---

# 3. Project Objectives

The major objectives of the project are:

1. To configure a controlled Virtual Machine environment.
2. To configure a controlled Docker Container environment.
3. To execute identical workloads in both environments.
4. To measure CPU performance using Sysbench.
5. To measure memory performance using Sysbench.
6. To evaluate disk I/O performance using fio.
7. To evaluate network performance using iperf3.
8. To evaluate application performance using FastAPI.
9. To measure startup and application-ready time.
10. To study scalability under increasing workloads.
11. To repeat benchmark experiments to reduce the effect of temporary fluctuations.
12. To store raw benchmark outputs separately from processed results.
13. To process benchmark data using Python and Pandas.
14. To generate comparison graphs using Matplotlib.
15. To calculate statistical measures such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.
16. To summarize VM and container performance using comparison tables.
17. To maintain the complete experiment in a reproducible GitHub repository.

---

The experiment investigates the following questions:

1. How does CPU performance differ between a VM and a container under the same workload?
2. How do memory operations behave in the two environments?
3. How do sequential and random disk workloads differ between the environments?
4. How does network throughput vary between the VM and container configurations?
5. How does the same FastAPI application behave in both environments?
6. How does startup time differ between the two deployment environments?
7. How does each environment scale when workload intensity is increased?
8. How much variation exists between repeated benchmark executions?
9. What resource-utilization patterns are observed during the experiments?

| Latency             | ms           |

Optional scalability testing can be performed using `wrk`.

```bash
wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

---

# 17. Startup-Time Experiment

Startup performance was evaluated for the application environment.

The measurements consider:

* Environment startup
* Application startup
* Application-ready time

A controlled Docker startup can be tested using:

```bash
time docker run --rm \
  -d \
  --name startup-test \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  performance-api
```

Stop the container:

```bash
docker stop startup-test
```

Multiple repetitions should be used because startup time can vary between runs.

### Startup Results

| Environment |       Startup Time | Application Ready Time |
| ----------- | -----------------: | ---------------------: |
| VM          | Not recorded | Not recorded |
| Container   | 0.898 s | Not recorded |

---

# 18. Scalability Experiment

Scalability was evaluated by increasing the workload intensity.

## CPU Scalability

```bash
for threads in 1 2 4 8
do
  sysbench cpu \
    --cpu-max-prime=20000 \
    --threads=$threads \
    --time=30 \
    run
done
```

The results are used to study performance as the number of threads increases.

## API Scalability

```bash
wrk -t1 -c10 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

```bash
wrk -t2 -c50 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

```bash
wrk -t4 -c100 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

```bash
wrk -t4 -c200 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

The following metrics are observed:

* Throughput
* Latency
* CPU utilization
* Memory utilization
* Failed requests

---

# 19. Automated Benchmark Execution

Automation scripts were used to maintain consistent benchmark parameters.

Example CPU automation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

OUTPUT_DIR="results/raw/cpu"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

for threads in 1 2 4 8
do
    echo "Running CPU test with $threads threads"

    sysbench cpu \
      --cpu-max-prime=20000 \
      --threads=$threads \
      --time=30 \
      run > "$OUTPUT_DIR/cpu_${threads}_threads.txt"
done

echo "CPU benchmark completed."
```

The script is stored under:

```text
scripts/run_cpu.sh
```

Similar scripts can be used for:

* Memory
* Disk
* Network
* Metric collection
* Result processing
* Graph generation

Automation improves consistency and reduces manual execution errors.

---

# 20. Result Collection and Processing

Raw benchmark output is preserved without modifying the original measurements.

### Raw Results

```text
results/raw/
```

### Processed Results

```text
results/processed/
```

### Figures

```text
results/figures/
```

For example:

```text
results/processed/cpu_results.csv
```

Example CSV format:

```csv
environment,threads,execution_time,events_per_second
VM,<measured>,<measured>,<measured>
VM,<measured>,<measured>,<measured>
Container,<measured>,<measured>,<measured>
Container,<measured>,<measured>,<measured>
```

The numerical values in the final analysis are taken from the actual experimental measurements.

---

# 21. Statistical Analysis

Python and Pandas are used to process the benchmark results.

Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(
    "results/processed/cpu_results.csv"
)

summary = df.groupby("environment")[
    "events_per_second"
].agg([
    "mean",
    "median",
    "min",
    "max",
    "std"
])

print(summary)
```

### Statistical Measures

| Measure            | Meaning                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Mean               | Average performance                   |
| Median             | Middle value of repeated measurements |
| Minimum            | Lowest observed value                 |
| Maximum            | Highest observed value                |
| Standard Deviation | Variation between measurements        |

Repeated measurements help identify normal performance variation and unusually high or low observations.

---

# 22. Performance Difference Calculation

Different performance metrics require different comparison formulas.

## Execution Time

For execution time:

```text
Difference (%) =
((VM Time - Container Time) / VM Time) × 100
```

Python:

```python
difference = (
    (vm_time - container_time)
    / vm_time
) * 100
```

## Throughput

For throughput:

```text
Difference (%) =
((Container Throughput - VM Throughput)
 / VM Throughput) × 100
```

Python:

```python
difference = (
    (container_throughput - vm_throughput)
    / vm_throughput
) * 100
```

The formula used should always be stated with the corresponding metric.

A percentage difference should not automatically be described as "overhead" unless the calculation specifically measures overhead.

---

# 23. Results

The following sections summarize the measured experimental results.

> **Note:** The numerical values below should be populated using the actual benchmark measurements stored in `results/raw/` and `results/processed/`. No assumed benchmark values are used.

* API throughput → requests/sec
* API latency → milliseconds

---

# 25. Performance Applications

The experiments represent several practical workloads used in real computing environments.

## 25.1 CPU-Intensive Applications

The Sysbench CPU workload represents applications involving substantial computational processing.

Examples include:

* Scientific computing
* Mathematical processing
* Data processing
* Batch computation
* CPU-intensive backend services

---

## 25.2 Memory-Intensive Applications

The memory benchmark represents applications that perform large numbers of memory operations.

Examples include:

* In-memory data processing
* Caching systems
* Data analytics
* Large data structures
* Memory-intensive services

---

## 25.3 Storage-Intensive Applications

The fio workload represents storage-heavy applications.

Examples include:

* Databases
* File servers
* Data pipelines
* Logging systems

---

## 25.5 Application Workloads

The FastAPI application provides a practical application-level workload.

The three endpoints represent:

| Endpoint   | Workload                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `/health`  | Lightweight request processing |
| `/compute` | CPU-intensive processing       |
| `/memory`  | Memory-intensive processing    |

This allows the experiment to move beyond synthetic benchmarks and observe application-level behavior.

---

# 26. Discussion

The experiment evaluates VM and container environments using multiple workload categories rather than relying on a single benchmark.

The analysis considers:

* Raw benchmark measurements
* Repeated runs
* Statistical summaries
* Resource utilization
* Application-level performance
* Startup behavior
* Scalability

The results should be interpreted together with the experimental configuration.

For example, CPU results should be considered alongside:

* Number of allocated CPUs
* Number of benchmark threads
* Host workload
* VM configuration
* Container CPU limits

Similarly, disk results depend on:

* Storage device
* Virtual disk configuration
* Mounted directory
* Docker storage configuration
* fio parameters

Network results depend on:

* Network mode
* Client/server arrangement
* NAT or bridged networking
* Number of parallel streams

Therefore, the measured results represent the behavior of the specific experimental configuration used in this project.

---

# 27. Limitations

The experiment has several limitations.

1. The results depend on the hardware used for the experiment.
2. Host-system background activity can influence measurements.
3. VM performance depends on hypervisor configuration.
4. Container performance depends on Docker configuration.
5. Disk results depend on the underlying physical and virtual storage layers.
6. Network measurements depend on the selected network configuration.
7. Repeated measurements reduce random variation but cannot eliminate all environmental effects.
8. The experiments represent selected workloads and do not cover every possible application.
9. The results should not automatically be generalized to every VM or container platform.
10. Performance can change with different hardware, operating systems, hypervisors, container runtimes, resource limits, and workloads.

# 31. Conclusion

This project provides an experimental comparison of Virtual Machines and Docker Containers using controlled workloads.

The study covers:

* CPU performance
* Memory performance
* Disk I/O
* Network performance
* FastAPI application performance
* Startup time
* Scalability
* Resource utilization
* Statistical analysis

The comparison is based on measurements collected from the actual experimental environment.

Repeated benchmark runs, raw data preservation, processed CSV files, statistical analysis, and graphical visualization provide a structured approach to evaluating the two environments.

The final conclusion is based on the **measured results obtained during the experiment**, rather than assuming beforehand that either Virtual Machines or Containers will always provide better performance.

The project demonstrates how controlled benchmarking can be used to understand the performance characteristics of different virtualization and deployment environments.

## 📝 Final Note

All reported numerical results and graphs in this project are based on measurements collected during the experiment. Where measurements were not available, the result is explicitly marked as **Not recorded** or **N/A** rather than being estimated.

The project is designed so that another user can inspect the configuration, reproduce the workloads, process the measurements, and understand how the final comparison was obtained.
